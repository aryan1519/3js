Lesson 9 Textures

* Loaded and used textures
* used loadingManager and callbacks
* used textures transformations such as repeating, wrapping, offsets, pivot change
* used filters such as minFilter and magFilter

Use minFilter when the texture is large

Use magFilter when the texture is very small and thus causes blurriness. magFilter will adjust accordingly and make it sharper
